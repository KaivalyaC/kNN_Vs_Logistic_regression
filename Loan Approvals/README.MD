<b>High level outline:</b>
This is a prediction model for automating the loan approval process for a large regional bank based on data of past loans which were approved and not approved.

<b>Brief background section</b>
The dataset has 690 datapoints/ loan details included the features as mentioned below:
- Debt
- Marital status
- Bank customer (existing or new)
- Employment type
- Prior default
- Employment
- Drivers license
- Citizenship
- Years employed
- Credit score
- Income

> <b>What is the problem?</b><br>
This problem deals with predicting the approvals for consumer loans for a regional bank. Automation of this process will also speed up the loan approval process, therefore increasing the business for the bank, and leading to higher profits.

> <b>Why is it important?</b><br>
Consumer loans make up a large section of banks' lending portfolio, hence it is important for the bank to be careful while approving loans to new customers. Banks need to monitor and control the delinquency rates of their loans and this process starts with onboarding the right customers.

> <b>Who are the key stakeholders?</b><br>
Accurately predicting the approvals for new loans is of key interest to banks and loan agents. Banks stand to gain through ease of doing business, and loan agents can get quicker processing done for their clients.

From this, we can see that student loans are the highest contributor in Non Performing Assets (loans over 90+ days). Student loans have the highest delinquency rates of around 12%, while typically other loans such as Mortgage and Auto Loans see better repayment levels, with their delinquency levels being on the lower side, at around 2-3%.
